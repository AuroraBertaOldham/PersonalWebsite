					<p>I'm a programmer and game developer currently making Everchanging at <a href="https://beacongames.com/">Beacon Games</a>. I'm also working on various other projects that you can learn more about below.</p>
					<p>
						On a more personal note, I was born in Canada 🍁 on March 28th, 1998 and later moved to the United States 🗽 when I was 9. During highschool, I taught myself how to program
						in my spare time and decided to pursue a career in indie game development after graduation. After years of self-discovery, I started my transition from male to female 🏳️‍⚧️ at 21 and it has been the best decision I've ever made. 
						When I'm not programming 👩‍💻, I enjoy playing the electric guitar 🎸, chatting with friends, and occasionally playing video games 🎮. I also love cats 🐱.
					</p>
					<p>
						I primarily program in C# and Rust but I also have varying amounts of experience with JavaScript, C, C++, and Vala. Before I began developing the EvEngine, I started working on several different projects in the Unity game engine. 
						Aside from programming, I have some experience in web design, graphic design, pixel art.
