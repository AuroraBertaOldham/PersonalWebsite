					<p>I'm a programmer and game developer currently making Everchanging at <a href="https://beacongames.com/">Beacon Games</a>. I'm also working on various other projects that you can learn more about below.</p>
					<p>
						On a more personal note, I was born in Canada üçÅ on March 28th, 1998 and later moved to the United States üóΩ when I was 9.  I began teaching myself how to program in middle school and decided to pursue a career in indie game development after graduating high school.
						When I'm not programming üë©‚Äçüíª, I enjoy chatting with friends, reading üìñ , playing video games üéÆ, drinking tea ‚òï, and spending time with my cats üê±.
					</p>
					<p>
						I primarily program in C# and Rust, but I also have varying amounts of experience with C, Vala, and JavaScript. Before I began developing the EvEngine,
						I started working on several different projects in the Unity game engine. Aside from programming, I have some experience in web design, graphic design, pixel art.
